# featherTuner

## What it does

It tells the frequency/pitch of a guitar string.

## How it does it

With a piezo sensor, the guitar headstock's vibrations are converted into a voltage, which the Arduino (a Feather ESP32 S2 Reverse TFT) processes using Fast Fourier Transform to provide the output frequency in Hz.
